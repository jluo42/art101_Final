              <p> Burro’s tail thrives indoors in a well-drained container where bright sunlight is on the plant.
                It is recommended to slowly introduce the plant to full sun once purchased to allow it to acclimate first,
                as light conditions vary from nursery to nursery, etc.  </p>

                 <h3> Care & Maintence  </h3> <br></br>
                 <p> To care for your plant, provide even moisture and fertilize with cactus food during the growing season.
                   Divide the plant when it gets too large for a container and transplant it every couple of years to give it fresh new soil. </p> <br></br>

              <p> It is recommended that Jade plants get full sun in order to grow properly. If they do not have full sun, they may become stunted and leggy.
                Proper Temperature for Jade Plants Jade plant care instructions say that jade plants do best in day time temperatures of
                65-75 F. (18-24 C.) during the day and 50-55 F. (10-13 C.) at night.</p>

                 <h3> Care & Maintence  </h3> <br></br>
                 <p> Do not let a jade plant dry out completely. However, be sure to not water a jade plant too often, as this can cause root rot.
                   If your jade plant is losing leaves or has leaf spots, this is most commonly caused by too little water.  </p> <br></br>

              <p> Devil’s ivy can thrive in both bright sunlight or dim lighting inside your home. The only lighting conditions it can’t tolerate are full, direct sun and complete darkness.
                If exposed to bright, filtered light, your devil’s ivy will have more yellow variegation in its leaves.​ </p>
